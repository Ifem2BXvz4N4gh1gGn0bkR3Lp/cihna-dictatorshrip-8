[[flg-intolerance]]
==== Falun Gong dislikes several other groups like homosexuals and some other religions

Like most <<flg-religion,old religions>>, related: <<hate-speech>>.

<<flg-canon,Canon quote>> from https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/lectures/19980904L.html[]:

____
Question: Why is homosexuality considered immoral?

Teacher: Think about it, everyone: Is homosexuality human behavior? Heaven created man and woman. What was the purpose? To procreate future generations. A man being with a man, or a woman with a woman - it doesn't take much thought to know whether that's right or wrong. When minor things are done incorrectly, a person is said to be wrong. When major things are done incorrectly, it's a case of people no longer having the moral code of human beings, and then they are unworthy of being human.
____

<<ciro-santilli>> strongly disagrees with that view, because it is the type of thing that makes people feel bad for characteristics that they have, but cannot change.

Also, it is very hard to pass any kind of law that forces people not to be racist/discriminatory, because there is always the lingering question: what if they are right about a particular point?

Because clearly everyone has innate characteristics that make them better suited for certain activities than others, we when we select candidates for a job, we are basically discriminating amongst candidates.

Also any such law can have the opposite effect, acting as a justification for further hate.

You and I dislike certain personality traits without any logical reason.

Democracy dislikes dictators, and it is not necessarily rational.

===== Falun Gong on races

<<li-hongzhi>> clearly classifies races as a metaphysical concept e.g. on <<flg-canon>> https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/lectures/19990502L.html[]:

____
Strictly speaking, Indians, Egyptians, Persians, the yellow race, the white race, and the black race are the six major races of the present Earth. All the other ones are mixed races.
____

Mixed race people seem to have some metaphysical defect/peculiarity, https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/lectures/1997L.html[]:

___
Question: What did you say last time that a person of mixed race has lost?

Teacher: He has lost the body that comes from the top down through to here. Let me put it this way: People of the yellow race have people of the yellow race up there, and people of the white race have people of the white race up there. He's lost this thread.
___

but they can still go to Heaven:

____
Question: Can a person of mixed race succeed in cultivation?

Teacher: Whether someone can cultivate and whether he can succeed in cultivation are all up to the person himself. If a person of mixed race can persist in cultivation, he can reach Consummation just the same. When he succeeds in cultivation his Primordial Spirit will return to wherever he came from.
____

[[flg-medication]]
==== FLG believers are less likely to take necessary medication

Based on what <<ciro-santilli>> saw and heard, he does believe, without any clear statistical evidence, that it is very likely that it hs happened to in many cases that some Falun Gong believers refused to take modern medications and died of diseases that could be otherwise cured.

But consider the following:

* what matters are statistics. Maybe FLG people live longer than non FLG in average. But we will never have statistics because of censorship: https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/27529/have-many-falun-gong-practitioners-forgone-medical-treatment-and-died-of-treatab
* maybe people should be link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_legislation[allowed to choose how they want to die], and not to take medication if they don't want to
+
As the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parks_and_Recreation[Parks and Recreation] caricaturally liberal character https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Swanson[Ron Swanson] puts it https://youtu.be/_UlNnETAZeI?t=48[about the United States]:
+
____
The whole point of this country is if you wanna eat garbage, balloon up to six hundred pounds and die of a heart attack at forty three, you can! You are free to do so. To me that's beautiful.
____
+
<<freedom-with-a-capital-f>> also comes to mind.
* maybe the number of people killed during persecution vastly outnumbers those who died because they would not take medication
* several <<flg-religion,religions>>, including <<christianity>> have miraculous cure claims. My impression is that claims were mostly notable in the old times apparently, likely because people noticed that Christians were still dying of all kinds of diseases like everyone else, no matter how devout!
* maybe the main reason why communists banned Falun Gong is the political threat it posed, but that a ban was unjustified given the situation. Christian crosses are being taken down as of 2016, have they stopped taking their medications as well? See also <<rule-of-law>>.
* maybe many of those people would also have died soon even if they had taken medication
* maybe not all Falun Gong believers thought that it was wise to stop taking medication. But their religion was banned anyway. Who can agree and follow all the innumerable prescriptions of any religious or legal system? See also: <<thoughtcrime>>.
* all the following also reduce people's lifespan:
+
--
** riding motorcycles vs. cars/buses
** smoking
** moving to a poor country to do charity there
** eating fast food
--
+
Forbidding them also has huge humanitarian costs (more expensive vehicles, creation of a black market, ...). So why not forbid them as well?

Especially In the beginning, Falun Gong did put a lot of emphasis on its health benefits, just <<zhong-gong,like all the other contemporaneous Qi Gong practices>>, and it is likely that especially many in the first generation of believers do believe it more than others.

For example, the main initial public announcement of Falun Gong was at a <<history-of-falun-gong,Health Exposition in Beijing>>.

In <<flg-canon>> itself, this is not super explicit and emphasised as far as Ciro can see. Zhuan Falun https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/zfl_74.htm[] has a chapter entitled "On the Issue of Healing Illnesses", that contains:

____
 Let us talk about the most common illnesses, like tumors, infections or osteoproliferation etc., found in the human body. In another space, a very deep space, there lies an evil intelligent entity.
____

and the general very beaty-around-the-bush suggestion that if you do master Falun Gong fully, you will be healthy. But with the usual disclaimer that "you have to become a master", and since "there are no graduates", no one is ever a master for sure, and as usual "you don't get the promised goodies", as as mentioned at: <<orange-papers>>.

https://www.falundafa.org/book/eng/mgjf.htm contains some more direct quotes that suggest that you can take medicine, but you have to try and bear the pain first, and if you can't, it's a sign that you haven't practiced Falun Gong well enough:

____
So when you take medicine now you're killing this sickness or the virus at the surface. Medicine can truly kill viruses at the surface. Yet a practitioner's gong[7] is automatically destroying viruses and karma. But as soon as medicine kills the surface virus that has seeped over from other dimensions, the virus—karma—over on the other side will know, since everything is alive, and it will stop coming over. Then you feel that you've recovered because you took the medicine. But let me tell you that it nonetheless accumulates over there. Life after life human beings are accumulating this stuff. When the accumulation reaches a certain extent, the person becomes incurable and when he dies he's totally destroyed. He loses his life—forever loses his life. That's how horrifying it is. So here I've explained to you the relationship. It's not that people aren't allowed to take medicine. When an everyday person gets sick he definitely needs medical treatment.

But how do we cultivators deal with it? Aren't we purifying your body? Like the annual rings of a tree, there is karma at the very core, and at every layer, life after life, of your body. When you practice cultivation, I keep pushing this karma outward from the center; I push, and push, and push, and push until I completely push the karma out for you. And not all of this can go through the surface of our bodies. You wouldn't be able to bear it if all of it were to go through the surface of your body. Only a portion of it comes out through the surface. But you still feel that you're suddenly getting sick, you find it terribly uncomfortable and painful, can't bear it, regard yourself as an everyday person, and go take medicine. Then you can go ahead and take medicine, as we've never said that everyday people can't take medicine. We only say that your enlightenment quality isn't up to par and that you didn't pass this test well.
____

Ciro does however believe that newer generations believe in this much less, notably because the first believer generation is all basically old or dead, and soon will be entirely dead. This might also have been de-emphasised to reduce the bullshit aspects and help the international spread of Falun Gong. Not even Falun Gong believers are that blind. And this perfectly mimics the beginning of Christianism, where the first generations gave much more emphasis to miraculous cures.

<<me-and-li-by-ben-hurley-2017>> has an anecdote on this, which Ciro feels sounds believable:

[[me-and-li-tumor]]
____
I think it was Lynn's* death that finally made me realise it was time to leave. I'd seen the writing on the wall about a year prior when I saw her at a yearly "Fa conference" for believers of Falun Gong, otherwise known as Falun Dafa, to exchange experiences and grow spiritually together. An executive assistant at a Queensland valuation firm, I'd gotten to know her over the years in various events as a warm and level-headed lady who had time for everyone. But I'd noticed she had developed a bulge on the side of her head and I was trying not to look at it when I talked to her. I saw, or at least I believed I saw, some pain in her smile. She was probably questioning herself over and over again what "attachments" she hadn't let go of that were causing this sickness to spread through her body and endanger her life. I wanted to tell her to just go to a hospital, although I wasn't at this stage resolute enough in my gradual return to logic. Another part of me feared that by looking at it I was acknowledging it — something you don't do with illnesses in Falun Gong because Master Li Hongzhi teaches that his pupils don't get illnesses. He can cure you but only if you don't have any loopholes in your belief in him and his teachings. Some people with solid beliefs can actually die due to others around them having flaws in their thinking, Li says. Just thinking the wrong way is perilous when you're a Falun Gong practitioner.

I later heard through the grapevine of Lynn's death. The cancer went into her brain and she passed away in extreme pain, probably believing to the end that it was her fault she was in this awful predicament. In a way, I guess it was.
____

and more interesting anecdotes follow, see source.

And Ciro has felt this first hand with his <<wife,mother-in-law>>. Whenever she has a health worry, first she tries to hide it. But then she casually mentions it without much thought because she speaks all the time the poor lady, may she be blessed. And then, when Ciro says: OK, let's try and treat it, even for trivial things that might have simple treatments, she immediately smiles a compassionate smile of "I'm a Falun Gong believer, I don't need that". This makes Ciro really mad. He tries to not show it, because he thinks people should be able to choose how they die. But Li promises the powers of <<flg-cross-dimensional-vision,remote, cross dimensional and past/future vision>> to some believers, and yet, blinds some of them to the obvious fact that they are aging, and, slowly but surely, their own bodies are starting to fail, like everyone else's will at one point.

It is also interesting to note how the Chinese government itself supported Falun Gong and <<zhong-gong,other Qi Gong practices>> for their health benefits, which is why they grew so large in the first place. <<li-hongzhi>> was even <<history-of-falun-gong,awarded prizes and recognized as a Qi Gong master by state backed organizations in 1992 and 1993>>. And the CCP still has a tendency to support certain non-scientific traditional practices: <<support-for-non-scientific-traditional-practices>>.

[[freedom-with-a-capital-f]]
.https://youtu.be/kIpaDW3RwtY?t=244 one random thing ex-KGB spy undercover in the USA Jack Barsky mentioned in this BuzzFeed Multiplayer interview stuck to his mind: "The one thing that you have here, that I believe cannot be found anywhere else in the world is called Freedom, with a capital F". If people want to die in a certain way, or believe that some bullshit will cure them, they should be allowed. Natural selection will take care of the rest.

[[falun-gongs-view-of-epidemics]]
===== Falun Gong's view of epidemics

<<li-hongzhi>> has said in <<flg-canon,canon>> things that lead certain believers (including e.g. <<wife,Ciro's mother in law>>) to believe that because they are good Falun Gong believers, that they are more safe from disease from evil people.

For example, in the 2003 "Fa conference" at the time of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome[SARS] he https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/lectures/20030420L.html[said]:

____
You must have seen the epidemic that's come along in China now, right? Hasn't a huge epidemic arrived? To put it in human terms, it's Heaven punishing people. What it's targeting, we Dafa disciples know full well: it's targeting those who don't deserve to be saved, who are impossible to save while Dafa disciples clarify the truth, and who aren't useful to the evil rotten spirits. This is the first round of cleansing. Heaven is punishing the evil, yet China is still lying to cover up the number of deaths, and I'll tell you, it's huge, and it hasn't peaked yet. 
____

Such beliefs have of course carried over directly to <<covid,COVID-19>>.

An amazing quote from https://en.minghui.org/html/articles/2020/3/20/183715.html[]:

____
Stay Rational

Pandemics and plagues are part of a divine plan and inevitable in the course of history.
____

Stay rational. Believe in God ;-)

Epidemics are also likely moments where religious grow due to more people being more desperate and looking for solace that cannot be found in this shitty world.

It is indeed tempting to believe that the virus magically kills only the Evil. What reality could be so fucked up where the innocent suffocate to their death? And yet, here we are.

[[li-hongzhi]]
==== Li Hongzhi (LHZ, 李洪志)

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Hongzhi
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/李洪志

Li Hongzhi is the creator of <<falun-gong>>: link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Hongzhi[].

Falun Gong people call him "master" (师父), which is a common traditional term used to respectfully address experienced teachers in a disciple (弟子)/teacher relation, e.g. Kung Fu or other crafts.

However they also believe that he has many many God-like powers and is comparable figures such as Jesus and Buddha himself.

Notably they believe that he has superpowers, and that everything that he says is the absolute truth of the universe, see also: <<flg-religion>>.

The term "master" is also used for example in the fictional film The Master (2012), which is likely inspired in <<flg-religion,Scientology>>.

<<ciro-santilli>> however prefers to call him <<flg-religion,prophet>>, since he feels LHZ is indistinguishable from <<flg-religion,any other religion>>. Guru/<<flg-cult,cult leader>> could also apply.

It's funny that even though Falun Gong only came up recently in the 80's, we still know relatively little about Li. One is kind of reminded of Jesus! See also <<li-hongzhis-family>> and <<li-hongzhis-hagiography>>.

One should note however that this is partly by design: at some point in the 90's, Li relatively stepped away from public view. This is because once you reach a critical mass of followers, it is better to let them to the preaching for you, while you hide your obvious human defects in a corner. See also comments at <<vissarion>>.

===== Xi Hongzhi and Li Jinping

In an alternate reality, Xi Hongzhi, not to be confused with <<xi-jinping>>, is an obscure peasant trying to save his kingdom from oppression.

And Li Jinping, not to be confused with <<li-hongzhi>>, is an evil Qi Gong who uses his powers to rule over his kingdom ruthlessly, ridding it of non-believers.

This meme would be offensive to both <<ccp>> and <<falun-gong>> believers.

We are entering Encyclopedia Dramatica territory here.

===== FLG is dangerous because Li Hongzhi has too much power over followers

Ciro agrees that there is danger in every religion, and especially new religions.

However the same point can be made about political parties and in particular the CCP and its chairman.

Couldn't a charismatic leader chairman gain more and more power (like Xi seems to be doing), and eventually start a war and kill millions? Or just kill some minority who is not happy about the situation.

Similarly, any charismatic leader of a pro-democracy movement could become the leader of a terrorist organization.

If you ever want democracy, you will have to learn to accept the beliefs of others, and only punish them when they actually break a law.

Finally, LHZ was born in 1951, so he will die in 20 years, unless FLG is true and a miracle happens, and then this argument will become invalid.

From what Ciro hears, LHZ has always maintained that he is the only source of truth on FLG (see also "The Guru is always right"), and therefore, so his death will very likely remove any danger once and for all.

Furthermore, it also seems to Ciro that FLG is clearly anti-violence and self-harm, so Ciro wonder how many would follow a contradictory order such as killing or suicide? We have had no hint of any incitation to violence so far.

It is also interesting to look into the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown case. When the suicide order came, most people wanted out! Without physically controlling the followers, I don't think you can make them do much.

===== Li Hongzhi's hagiography

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Hongzhi mentions that there are two versions of the biography:

* An unofficial biography appeared in the first of Li's major publications, <<flg-canon,Zhongguo Falun Gong>>, supposedly authored by journalist Zhu Huiguang (朱慧光).
+
The full text appears to be at available at: http://qingqing.freebbs.tw/viewthread.php?tid=130### (God bless <<taiwan,Taiwanese>> piracy, link:++https://web.archive.org/web/20200805093333/http://qingqing.freebbs.tw/viewthread.php?tid=130###++[archive])
+
<<benjamin-penny-the-life-and-times-of-li-hongzhi-2003>> gives the full title of the section + a translation (originally in pinyin, but why?!?! :-)):
+
____
法輪旋轉新天地-記李洪志先生和他創立的法輪功 +
"The wheel of the law revolves the new cosmos - on Li Hongzhi and the Falun Gong he founded".
____
* A second, official spiritual biography appeared in early editions of <<flg-canon,Falun Gong's primary text, Zhuan Falun>>.
+
It is shorter than the first, and is marked as authored by the "Falun Dafa Research Society's President" (法轮功研究会会长).
+
The Wiki quotes <<benjamin-penny-the-religion-of-falun-gong-2012>>.
+
Penny says that it was removed in 1999 (presumably to remove some more glaring magical bullshit help with internationalization).
+
A possible Chinese copy might be found at: http://qingqing.freebbs.tw/viewthread.php?tid=165### inside a 1994 version of Zhuan Falun.
+
The section is entitled "中国法轮功创始人、法轮功研究会会长 李洪志先生小传", so literally tranlated as a "profile" (小传) rather than a full biography. The index marks it as 附 (addendum), and it comes at the end of the book.

===== Let's make a mini series about Li Hongzhi's life

Ciro can't help but to imagine how Falun Gong came about in detail.

Someone should write a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Temptation_of_Christ_(novel)["The Last Temptation of Christ"].

This deserves an American miniseries like Chernobyl.

It would manage to piss off both FLG and the CCP, which would be amazing. It is a shame that it is so difficult to find good historical information between the infinite barrages of CCP and FLG propaganda.

It could show how:

* Li was an ordinary dude who could liked to play the trumpet, which partially explains his focus on <<falun-gong-media,Shen Yun>> and Falun Gong musical street parades
* Li first heard about Qi Gong, and went to practice it under some dude. Then how he saw other people were so into it, and decided to take this opportunity to make a career out of it during the 80's
* how he met his wife and had a daughter
* how he started to notice how people were feeling things during the exercise classes, and started suggesting more and more metaphysics to these first disciples
* Li could also have some metaphysical moment, like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PW20LbwAmng but at the same time, he must tell his followers some lies which he does not believe
* how followers started telling others things and "experience sharing" where the cycle of belief stats to take off
* a clear demonstration of how "A group of early adopters in Changchun became disenchanted after Li forbade his followers from charging fees for the practice at the end of 1994" showing dissent within the cult
* and finally, the immigration and crackdown, and how he put his fingers on those things, and the creation of media, this could be the last episode

Episodes could be split along:

* Episode 1: pre Qi Gong, shows Childhood, workplaces, early motivations. Ends with first contact with a Qi Gong lesson
* Episode 2: early Falun Gong. Opens an academy. Starts without metaphysics, but grows into it. Show him knowingly lying, but also seething magic things. The first followers, and top lieutenants. Makes some management mistake, but gets away with it. Could end in a metaphysical scene, or 13 May 1992 initial public lesson. Maybe a scene of Li's visit to <<thailand>> in 1983 (photo from CCP media found on Google).
* Episode 3: later Falun Gong in China. It grows, show in Chinese news. Power struggles, problems with early lieutenants, and new lieutenants come up. Many people practice on streets. Battle against <<zhong-gong>>. Near 1996, something tips Li off to the fact that the CCP is going to crack down on them, and so he announces that he will be spreading abroad full time. Check out if this was before or after the first Anti FLG newspaper article in 1996-06-17.
* Episode 4: preaching outside of China and emigration. American permanent residence in 1998. Watches crackdown on television. International Falun Gong media. Show him at Falun Gong New York <<dragon-springs,"Dragon Springs">> complex

Or maybe, never mind that boring post 1992 stuff which is already highly public, instead we could focus only on the more interesting pre-1992 events, and finish in 1992.

So per-early FLG up to 1992, with childhood flashbacks.

The tone should of course be a mixture of:

* personal insight of the master
* the love of a follower
* external view of their shortcomings

Parts of the series could be filmed in <<taiwan>> maybe?

Source material: <<history-of-falun-gong>>.

[[li-hongzhis-family]]
===== Li Hongzhi's family (李洪志的家庭)

Jesus appeared to value chastity. He was born from a virgin. No sex around him at all.

But Li doesn't need that. He's a God, right, he can both be an Enlightened God part time and still have a normal family part time.

Once thing Ciro approves about Li's approach to his family is that he seems to have stated (TODO source) that none of them are Gods like him.

Wife's name: Li Rui (李瑞 according to CCP). Report saying that a follower bought a house and registered it on Li Rui's name as a gift, but Li later returned the gift back: https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB94140245836194819 TODO house address.

This Falun Gong sources confirm that a "Christina Li" was a Shen Yun lead dancer as of 2011, but does not confirm that she is the daughter of Li Hongzhi: https://www.theepochtimes.com/where-are-the-ancient-arts-of-china-part-4_1491935.html If this is true, talk about <<orange-papers,"different levels of truth">>! The article also claims that she has had other pseudonyms, including: "Annie Li" and "Li Jingjing" (李晶晶). Here are web archives of the now broken of course Shen Yun pages Kaiwand links to as evidence of her constant name changing (but no mention of her father):

** possibly CCP sources report that Meige married in 2017, likely near the Falun Gong Day (13th May): e.g. http://www.saibeifeng.com/kfyd/201705/16/t20170516_5219554.shtml says many felicitation posts were posted on <<falun-gong-media,minghui>>, so this is likely widely known within the Falun Gong community, but the idiots who wrote that page don't know how to link to sources. Ciro could not find the groom's name.

===== Diary's of being in Thailand with Li Hongzhi's family (我与李洪志一家在泰国的日子——法轮功教主妹夫的自述)

An alleged account of Li Hongzhi's family in the 1980's written by his brother-in-law Sun Senlun (Natawut Smittipong, 孙森伦), who married Li Ping.

ISBN 9789996590252: https://www.cp1897.com.hk/product_info.php?BookId=9789996590252[]

[[zhong-gong]]
=== Zhong Gong (中功,中华养生益智功)

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhong_Gong
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/中华养生益智功

A very similar religion to <<falun-gong>>, that also emerged during the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qigong_fever[Qigong fever] (气功热) of the '80s and '90s.

Zhong Gong was the second most sucessful Qigong Boom religion after Falun Gong.

The similarity of their imagery as seen from propaganda videos is striking. To <<ciro-santilli>>, this makes Zhong Gong a perfect example of why <<does-ciro-santilli-believe-in-or-practice-falun-gong,FLG metaphysics is bullshit>>: it is obvious that both Zhong Gong and Falun Gong and many others were just random dudes who took advantage of the Qigong fever to create their religions.

Their prophet is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Hongbao[Zhang Hongbao] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/张宏堡[张宏堡]).

Interestingly, like <<li-hongzhi>>, Hongbao is also from the Northeast of China (Heilongjiang), there must be a reason why those Qi Gong movements come from that region.

Unlike Falun Gong however, Zhong Gong failed to branch the franchise out of China, and basically died out. Hongbao also died in a car crash in 2006 which didn't help. Li Hongzhi however played smarter, and started branching abroad full force in 1996, he likely predicted that the crackdown was inevitale.

Wikipedia says it reached 34 million followers in China.

Hongbao also has a more spicy history it seems, with sexual allegations and open political goals <<flg-political,unlike Li Hongzhi, who hid his goals better>>. Well played, Li, well played.

<<li-hongzhi>> maintains in <<flg-canon,canon>> that Falun Gong is of course extremely different from all of those other extremely similar Qi Gong religions. Zhong Gong is likely not mentioned by name, but it is also likely one of the main targets. E.g. in 1998 <<flg-canon,canon>> https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/lectures/19980329L.html[]:

____
Dafa can't be obtained lightly. For example, the diversity of cults and the number of false qigongs are large these days, and they lead people astray. Many people who are capable of cultivating get sucked into them, and some of them engage in suicide - it's a mess.
____

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2GxSJK9c-A this appears to be positive mainstream media coverage of Zhong Gong
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ziluy_AlEI video of Hongbao giving a lecture dated 1994 and commented "Qiling kylin Tianhua culture"
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQKCtPSfdR4 video dated January 21st, 2007 of Monks praying after his death
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvJSzeY7Chw contains a bunch of what appear to be extremely low quality Zhong Gong propaganda videos. It is very similar to Falun Gong's of course.

The embassy spokesman says Chinese officials have ample evidence of sect leader Zhang Hongbao's involvement in crimes such as rape and murder.

Most would find they had little in common with non-practitioners ("ordinary people" in Falun Gong parlance) but would maintain cordial relations with friends and family nonetheless, and think of various ways to explain the edge off some of Falun Gong's less palatable teachings about aliens, how heaven views gay people, the inferiority of other religions and Master Li's role in saving the universe.

____
Xi Jinping got his nickname as "Xi baozi 習包子" ("<<buns,steamed stuffed bun Xi>>") due to the much publicized visit he made to the famous Qìngfēng bāozi pù 庆丰包子铺 ("Qingfeng baozi shop") in Beijing. During and after his visit to the shop, media swarmed over the place and were eager to portray an image of Xi as being down to earth and close to the people. Those who dislike Xi use this nickname sarcastically against him for being a hick and for hypocritically "putting on a show" (zuòxiù 作秀).

Added to the Constitution in preparation for <<xi-abolishes-term-limits-2018-03,eternal rule>>.

<<xi-jinping>>'s <<little-red-book>>. But since it is the 21st century, there's an app for it instead called "Study (for a) Strong Country" (学习强国) designed by <<alibaba>>:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xuexi_Qiangguo
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/学习强国

Notably, it consists of 14 chapters, which are called "talks" (讲), e.g. the first talk (第一讲) etc. This is exactly like <<li-hongzhi>>'s <<flg-canon,Zhuan Falun>> (and likely like other ancient Chinese religious texts).

[[xuexi-qiangguo]]
===== Xuexi Qiangguo app (Study for a strong country app, 学习强国, xxqg, 2019)

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xuexi_Qiangguo
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/学习强国

App made by <<alibaba>> for the <<ccp>> to teach people <<xi-jinping-thought>>.

Literally means "study for a strong country".

One of the beautiful things about that name is that is reminds one of the <<slang,expression>> "强国人" (strong country person), coined in during the 2014 during the <<hong-kong-protests-2014>> to refer ironically to Mainland Chines people, due to their exaggerated self-perceived strength and superiority, see also <<wumao-2011-vs-little-pink-2021>>. A homonym "墙国" (wall country) is also known as a reference to the <<gfw>>, https://archive.ph/czYEv[sample usage].

The app appears to have both content, and also tests to check that you've read the bullshit.

At https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/mnulkd/china_is_forcing_chinese_to_use_national/gu05o20/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3 a <<reddit>> user explains:

____
Many people are also forced to use the app "强国学习" in order to keep their jobs. Especially government workers. They have to study XiJinPing thought for certain amount of time each week and do exams.
____

This is confirmed e.g. at: https://www.hf.uio.no/ikos/english/studies/voices-middle-east-asia/voices-from-east-asia/xuexi-qiangguo-%E2%80%93-digitalization-of-chinese-propaga.html

____

Within the first four months of Xuexi Qiangguo’s release, it was the most downloaded app in China with over 100 million downloads, surpassing China’s most popular messaging, social media and mobile payment app, <<wechat>> and the <<tiktok,Chinese version of TikTok, known as Douyin>>.

To use the app is not exactly voluntary. The Communist Party has issued directives that requires party members to download the app and use it. Many workplaces have done the same and it has been reported that employees are required to send screenshots to document their progress on the app. If they don’t, they are at risk of a pay deduction.

To put it in perspective, over 90 million Chinese are members of the Communist Party, and there are nearly 850 million internet users and almost 690 million smart phone users in China, as of 2019. It is, however, not clear whether the people who have downloaded the app genuinely are interested in learning about Xi Jinping’s political ideology, or if they feel like they must download it to show loyalty to the party.

[[fuck-xuexiqiangguo]]
====== Fuck-XueXiQiangGuo (Fuck学习强国)

https://github.com/fuck-xuexiqiangguo/Fuck-XueXiQiangGuo[]

This <<github>> repository appears to help cheat the Xuexi qiangguo, see also: <<github-repositories-with-censored-information>>.

The program's executable file name is actually `./Fuck学习强国`, a thing of beauty.

Several video demos can be found on YouTube:

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahHzi1rGDfA "2021@学习强国辅助之Ai强国&科技强国" by Axiom Show shows the Android App

And there there's an anti-repo for <<wumao>> who oppose the cheating: https://github.com/boycott-fuck-xuexiqiangguo/Boycott-Fuck-XueXiQiangGuo It had 150 stars as of 2021, as oppoesd to 7500 of the cheating repo.

https://github.com/TechXueXi/TechXueXi appears to be a "non-cheating" assistant? TODO confirm. It is at the very least more politically correct.

The repository was created by Tang Wenzheng (唐文正, <<github>> alias https://github.com/Xmader[Xmader]). https://chinadigitaltimes.net/chinese/663593.html According to https://chinadigitaltimes.net/chinese/663593.html form <<china-digital-times>>, he accidentally posted with his real name on an issue once (<<ciro-santilli>> knows that it is basically impossible not to when juggling multiple accounts simultaneously), and subsequently publicly announced his true identity. Following the name reveal, he did an AMA on <<terminus2049>> https://2047.name/t/11552[], and luckily he is abroad, and does not intend to come back. Wenzheng also created the https://github.com/china-digital-times/china-digital-times.github.io <<github>> pages mirror of <<china-digital-times>>, further discussed in that section. At https://github.com/fuck-xuexiqiangguo/Fuck-XueXiQiangGuo/issues/578 on 2021-03-03, he announced that he would stop working on the project because his parents weren't needing the APP anymore, succession wasn't announced. A few commits followed in the next days, but presumably minimal maintenance and ramp-down.

.Fuck-XueXiQiangGuo 2021 GitHub page screenshot with stars highlighted. 7k stars on a Chinese-only repository is a lot of stars, and very unlikely to be faked. This is what you should show <<wumao,wumaos>> when they that no Chinese person opposes the <<ccp>>.

Chinese version of the <<american-dream>>, which <<xi-jinping>> insists is completely different and superior to the <<american-dream>>.

The names suggest, they are not real, but just dreams.

Transcript for <<little-pink-american-dream-vs-chinese-dream,Little pink explains the difference between the American dream  and the Chinese dream>>:

____
美国梦是个人发财的梦 +
讲究冒险 +
通过个人奋斗达到所谓的成功 +
成为有产者 +
然后去剥削别人 +

中国梦是共同富裕 +
追求的是人民幸福 +

换句话说 +
美国梦是个人梦 +
是为美元的梦 +

中国梦是人民梦 +
是为人民服务的梦 +
这就是二者的本质区别 +

以后不要在我面前提起美国梦 +
俗气！ +
____

____
The American dream is a dream of personal wealth +
it focuses on risk taking +
to achieve so-called success through personal struggle +
and become a property owner +
and then exploit others +

The Chinese dream is common prosperity +
to pursue the happiness of the people +

In other words +
the American dream is an individualistic dream +
it is a dream of the Dollar +

The Chinese dream is the people's dream +
Is a dream of serving the people +
This is the essential difference between the two +

Don't bring up the American dream in front of me in the future +
Cheesy! +

===== Mao swim across the Yangtze river (毛主席畅游长江, 1966-07-16)

Good <<scmp>> article: https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/long-reads/article/1999098/chairman-maos-historic-swim-glorified-china

Mao claimed to have set a swimming record by swimming 15km in 65 minutes at the age of 72 at the Yangtze in Wuhan, or an average of 13.8 km/h.

As a comparison, the Olympic swimmers of 2016 covered the lesser distance of 10 km in 113 minutes: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_at_the_2016_Summer_Olympics_–_Men%27s_marathon_10_kilometre for an average of 5.3 km/h.

According to https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311977913_Analysis_of_the_characteristics_of_offshore_currents_in_the_Changjiang_Yangtze_River_estuarine_waters_based_on_buoy_observations[this article], the maximum current speed of the Yantze is 128.5 cm/s or 4.62 km/h so even if he were swimming with the current, Mao was faster.

Dictatorships would never lie about obviously verifiable facts, would they?

And idiots today still celebrate this event that preceded the <<cultural-revolution>> which put China's economy in shambles.

<<superputin>> learnt from this and also showed off his swimming skills in 2009.

https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/l2wqbg/ascii_art_of_tank_man_%E5%9D%A6%E5%85%8B%E4%BA%BA_from_tiananmen_square/gkdbe5d suggested a simpler one that has been in use with Chinese characters:

[[tank-man-emoticon]]
....
占占点人
....

where:

* the first three characters look like tanks (unrelated meaning)
* the fourth character looks like, and actually means person

So once a gain, <<chinese-characters-are-insane>>.

The poster features images related to the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_space_program[Chinese space program 中华人民共和国航天], which is a major undertaking of the CCP and widely used propaganda point. https://chineseposters.net/themes/falun-gong.php[Source].

.1962 propaganda poster for the Chinese Space program. "Uphold science, eradicate superstition"? Nah, the moon is obviously populated by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chang'e[Chang'e (嫦娥)], the Chinese Goddess of the moon, which is one of the names for the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Lunar_Exploration_Program[Chinese Lunar Exploration Program (中国探月工程,嫦娥工程)].

[[liu-xiaobo]]
==== Liu Xiaobo (刘晓波, 1955-2017)

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Xiaobo
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/刘晓波

He was abroad in the 80' as a scholar, and then he came back to china in 1989 to support <<tiananmen>>, then he was in and out of jail until he died in 2017.

2020-06 https://baike.baidu.com/item/刘晓波/14900221 (https://web.archive.org/web/20200627130112/https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%88%98%E6%99%93%E6%B3%A2/14900221[]) casually forgot to mention that he might have won the fucking 2010 Nobel Peace Prize, but he seems to be too big to delete the entire page?

It is interesting how <<hao-haidong>> was fully deleted, the page was only locked. It also does not mention all the times he was in jail, notably after Tiananmen, only some of them.

2017-11 Baidu did mention the Nobel prize however: https://web.archive.org/web/20171114165644/https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%88%98%E6%99%93%E6%B3%A2/14900221 it was edited out later.

The article also makes it very clear that his 2009 sentence was "a fair one", and that the organization he worked for in the 90', https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_for_a_Democratic_China[Federation fora Democratic China] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/民主中国阵线[民主中国阵线]) was funded by the CIA. Wikipedia does not mention that however, and of course, Baidu content does not need citations.

[[hao-haidong]]
===== Hao Haidong (郝海东, 2020)

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hao_Haidong
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/郝海东

Hao is widely considered one of the best Chinese soccer players of all time, and he was the top scorer for the Chinese national team of all time as of 2020, and one of the only two Chinese to show on https://iffhs.de/showLegends/men[IFFHS Legends] page which as of 2020 contains only 52 players including the likes of Pelé and Maradona.

He participated in the 1994, 1998, 2002 and 2006 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup[FIFA World Cup] (世界杯) qualifiers, and therefore also at the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_FIFA_World_Cup[2002 FIFA World Cup proper] held in South Korea and Japan, which is the only World Cup China classified for as of 2020, and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_at_the_FIFA_World_Cup[in which it failed to score a single goal].

On 2020-06-03, one day before <<tiananmen>> anniversary, Hao appeared with his wife https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ye_Zhaoying[Ye Zhaoying] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/叶钊颖[叶钊颖], married 2019), who was also a badmington star, on <<guo-wengui>>'s YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4aN5h0RqD8&t=4496[], and spoke up against the CCP:

* https://www.scmp.com/sport/china/article/3087684/chinese-sports-couple-hao-haidong-and-ye-zhaoying-face-being-wiped
* https://www.washingtonpost.com/9ae91df2-a6ec-11ea-898e-b21b9a83f792_story.html

As a result, his son https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runze_Hao[Hao Runze] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/郝潤澤[郝润泽], from a previous marriage) who is also a soccer player and had nothing to do with it was also sacked from the Serbian club https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FK_Radnički_Niš[Radnicki Nis] in which he played one week later due to pressure from China: https://www.scmp.com/sport/football/article/3088385/hao-haidongs-son-sacked-serbian-club-radnicki-nis-after-pressure The wiki page says that https://www.b92.net/sport/fudbal/vesti.php?yyyy=2020&mm=06&dd=09&nav_id=1693254 says the team says it was just a coincidence and that his contract had ended.

The most interesting thing about all of this, is how Hao's name was completely <<internal-censorship,nuked form the Chinese Internet>>, making this a fantastic opportunity to unambiguously document a censorship event. One is reminded of:

* <<censorship-of-images-in-the-soviet-union>>
* <<nineteen-eighty-four>> "Every record has been destroyed or falsified" quote

The keyword is clear: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iconoclasm[iconoclasm] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/破坏偶像主义[破坏偶像主义])

====== Zhihu censorship of Hao Haidong

<<zhihu>> (and the rest of the Chinese Internet) basically nuked a gazillion articles that mentioned him, including old ones that had nothing to do with his political views.

Ciro estimates that very likely thousands of Zhihu posts have been removed, as of 2020-06-14 the Google query "郝海东 site:zhihu.com" had 3,970 results, and every single on Ciro clicked had been taken down.

Not nuked yet as of 2020-06, but nuked after, with before-after archives:

====== Baidu Baike censorship of Hao Haidong

This served as good evidence of the obvious fact that <<baidu-baike>> is highly censored.

The article used to mention Hao extensively. He was:

* second on the 知名人物 (famous people)
* was the 进球最多者 (top scorer), a category which as completely removed
* the list 射手榜 (top scorers?) is still there but casually starts at 宿茂臻 with 27 goals, and skips Hao which has 41
* an entire section about Hao was removed entitled "永远的9号——郝海东" and saying how amazing he was, including a picture

Ye won the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BWF_World_Championships[BWF World Championships] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/世界羽毛球锦标赛[世界羽毛球锦标赛]), a biannual tournament that is likely the most prestigious in the world twice in 1995 and 1997, and her name had to be removed from the list of winners in Baidu https://baike.baidu.com/item/世界羽毛球锦标赛[]:

In 1995 and 1997 it seems that one the female singles (女子单打), even though they did happen in 1993 and 1997. How curious!

The fact that badminton is a single player sport is great in this case, as it just puts more emphasis on her name as opposed to Hao's multiplayer soccer game:

==== Chloe Zhao (赵婷, Zhao Ting, 2021)

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloé_Zhao
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/趙婷

Born and raised in China, moved to the West at age 15, but retained Chinese citizenship as far as is publicly known.

In 2013 she told the magazine Filmmaker https://web.archive.org/web/20130814185314/https://filmmakermagazine.com/people/chloe-zhao/[] (later removed from the website):

____
It goes back to when I was a teenager in China, being in a place where there are lies everywhere. You felt like you were never going to be able to get out. A lot of info I received when I was younger was not true, and I became very rebellious toward my family and my background. I went to England suddenly and relearned my history. Studying political science in a liberal arts college was a way for me to figure out what is real. Arm yourself with information, and then challenge that too.
____

TODO was that the only comment she ever made or is there more?

Won the 2021 Oscar (93rd) for best picture and best director on 2021-04-25 for her film Nomadland 无依之地.

On 2021-04-26 reports emerged that her win was being censored in China: https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-censors-nomadland-director-chloe-zhaos-oscar-win-11619440550 Unlike <<hao-haidong>> however, the order was much more specific: to censor only the fact that she won the Oscars.

As of 2021-04-27 her <<baidu-baike>> page https://baike.baidu.com/item/赵婷/22214113 was still up: https://web.archive.org/web/20210427075523/https://baike.baidu.com/item/赵婷/22214113  let's see how long it lasts. But the page failed to mention the minor detail that she on the Oscar. The comment section, which we're unable to archive contained two types comments:

* she's an American citizen now, not Chinese, just it wasn't reported. But no one has any proof.
* she won the Oscar

https://web.archive.org/web/20210413095903/https://baike.baidu.com/tashuo/browse/content?id=c9fdac1dcf27bdd1280ac9e1&lemmaId=22214113&fromLemmaModule=pcBottom contains a prediction that she would win the Oscar based on earlier recent wins.

The page for the 93rd Oscar mysteriously does not exit however: https://baike.baidu.com/item/第93届奥斯卡金像奖 unlike that of all others: https://baike.baidu.com/item/第92届奥斯卡金像奖 (https://archive.ph/wip/gGGtn[archive]) We can't find an archive either, but it is overwhelmingly likely that it was  created and later deleted.

On <<zhihu>> the topic 93rd Oscar "第93 届奥斯卡金像奖" https://www.zhihu.com/topic/21594057 was deleted:

* up 2021-04-09 https://archive.ph/dZAHE with 13 questions
* down 2021-04-27 https://archive.ph/wip/LYwOb

The Chloe Zhao topic https://www.zhihu.com/topic/20175085/hot was still up: 2021-04-27 with 8 questions: https://archive.ph/wip/CI3vz but funnily that website is so shit that it still links to some deleted questions e.g.: which used to read https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/368060294 "赵婷获第93届奥斯卡最佳导演奖，有思想的女孩子最可爱" but is down https://archive.ph/wip/6eiTl

so holy fuck, Ciro actually feels this one could honestly be a <<spy,CIA deletion request>>.

offcn is the short name for the company 中公教育党委 which literally means "Chinese Public Education Party". TODO what do they do exactly? They seem to have strong CCP party links: http://edu.people.com.cn/n1/2018/0510/c1006-29977260.html[], maybe they are a "corporate training" company for the CCP itself.

[[kaiwind]]
====== Kaiwind (pro-CCP media)

http://kaiwind.com/

Anti-religion, and notably, anti-<<falun-gong>> website in Chinese.

It must be said however that they do contain at least some information that seems to be true/interesting.

Including open secrets that every Falun Gong believer knows about but does discuss much publicly, e.g. details of <<li-hongzhis-family>>, and Sun Senjun's account.

Ciro has no proof that this is linked to the government, but it is very likely, even the Chinese embassy website links to it:

* http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/lj/t36322.htm
* https://web.archive.org/web/20180414233331/http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/lj/t36322.htm

[[falun-gong-media]]
==== Falun Gong media (法轮功媒体)

A great example of how <<falun-gong>> is <<flg-organized,highly organized>>.

Likely highly de-facto controlled by <<li-hongzhi>>, and extremely <<flg-transparent,lacking clear full disclosure of their affiliation>>.

For example, Li refers to Falun Gong media as "our media" in <<flg-canon>>, e.g.: https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/lectures/20090606L.html[].

It could be argued that those media are not "directly" controlled by Li Hongzhi, and Ciro does believe that they were created independently of him initially.

But without doubt they are controlled by his devout followers, and if Li Hongzhi ever gave directions, which Ciro has no proof he has ever done, then those media would follow.

Ciro believes without evidence that Li Hongzhi gives specific directives to the top tenants of those organizations from time to time when important issues arise. Ciro believes that one of such issues is the support of Donald Trump: <<flg-trump>>.

Furthermore, Li appears to directly cite some of the main media in Canon or talk at their conferences as Canon.

One thing must be said in their favour however: they are incorruptible in their fight against the CCP.

____
There are so many things you have to do. You have to do your ordinary job and do it well, you have to manage your family's affairs, and as Dafa disciples you need to make time for Fa-study and exercises; you also need to clarify the truth, as well as participate in Dafa projects, such as The Epoch Times.

[[china-uncensored]]
====== China Uncensored (pro-Falun Gong media)

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgFP46yVT-GG4o1TgXn-04Q

Syster interview podcast channel: China Unscripted: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_o1sZefER0E The three makers of China Uncesored appear on the videos.

Older shows had an "ndt.tv" water mark on top right, e.g. a 2013 video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMvS3lgJBs

The video description also links to http://e.ntd.tv/NTDChinaUncensored which is now down, but has archives such as https://web.archive.org/web/20130321071835/http://e.ntd.tv/NTDChinaUncensored which suggest a redirect back to the YouTube channel:

____

http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZZhVHPaO1ziCc9dRPrgbz2KU0aZF7CJ-

TODO why did newer videos remove the water mark and clear link? Did they break links, or just to hide Falun Gong influence?

Home page gives extremely unusual importance to Falun Gong resources, e.g.:

* http://www.chinauncensored.tv/about/ (https://web.archive.org/web/20190426203719/http://www.chinauncensored.tv/about/[archive]) "China Uncensored is available to watch on this website, on YouTube, on New Tang Dynasty Television"

[[minghui]]
===== Minghui (明慧网, Falun Gong media)

https://en.minghui.org/

Falun Gong's primary "social network"/"Falun Gong"-only news/propaganda website. More Falun Gong specific than <<epoch-times>>.

Literally: clear (明) wisdom (慧) network (网)

Li speaking to Minghui conference in <<flg-canon,canon>>: https://big5.falundafa.org/chibig5/jiangfa10_1.htm

TODO how https://www.clearwisdom.net/ compares?

[[shen-yun]]
===== Shen Yun Performing Arts (神韵艺术团, Falun Gong media)

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shen_Yun_Performing_Arts
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/神韵艺术团

A good testimony from an ordinary employee from 2013: <<aarvoll-shenyun,Aarvoll's account>>.

Openly directly controlled by <<li-hongzhi>>. He features as director on librettos, e.g. the 2013 one (credited "D. F." (Da Fa) and with his photo).

Shen Yun's headquarters are also located in/near <<dragon-springs>>.

Li mentions Shen Yun in <<flg-canon,canon>>: https://gb.falundafa.org/chigb/jiangfa11_2.htm

On thing Ciro couldn't help but notice is that the "CCP guards beating up Falun Gong people" scenes felt a lot like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_opera[Revolutinary operas] of the <<mao-zedong>> period in their aesthetics. Maybe this is an intentional reference.

.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mQ8plzWl9g "They tried to get me to post Chinese propaganda" by J.J. McCullough (2019) talks about Shen Yun and Falun Gong in general, and how he was offered to post anti-Shen Yun propaganda for 500 dollars.

[[bannedbook]]
===== bannedbook.org (禁闻网, pro-Falun Gong media)

The main Chinese name is 禁闻网 which stands for "banned news network", and is more accurate than the domain name "bannedbook" since the majority of material published appears to be recent banned articles.

Classifying this as Falun Gong media because most or possibly all of the sidebar recommended websites 推荐网站 are also Falun Gong media e.g. as of 2020-04: https://web.archive.org/web/20200427221744/https://www.bannedbook.org/[] includes <<epoch-times>> and https://hongzhi.li/[], so yeah, not much doubt.

From this we deduce that the "banned book" in the domain name originally likely referred more specifically to the banned Falun Gong sacred books: <<flg-canon>>.

Once again, <<flg-transparent>> is in need.

TODO who is behind this website? They store full text copies of banned articles, e.g. https://www.bannedbook.org/bnews/baitai/20190816/1175647.html is a full text copy of http://yashalong.blog.caixin.com/archives/188877 which is mentioned at: <<nazi>>.

[[tuidang]]
===== Tuidang movement (退党, Falun Gong media)

* https://tuidang.org/
* https://en.tuidang.org/

Falun Gong campaign asking Chinese people to revoke their CCP membership.

Extremelly common when <<falun-gong-preaching>> on the streets in touristic areas where Chinese tourists will be present. Fake names will be accepted, so it is obviously just a symbolic act.

A bit less than 10% of the Chinese population are registered CCP members: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party[]. So it is not obligatory, and there likely restrictions. But there must also be some kind of benefits involved. See also: https://daily.jstor.org/communist-party-of-china/

* https://github.com/china-digital-times/data/ the data

Firs commit  Jun 30, 2019. The first article is from 2010, so maybe it did scrape everything. It appears to be automatically updated daily. The images seem to be re-uploaded to https://statically.io/[], e.g. https://china-digital-times.github.io/?/id/664606 contains https://cdn.statically.io/gh/china-digital-times/files/master/2021/04/image-1617989397104.png which just fetches from GitHub automatically: https://github.com/china-digital-times/files/blob/master/2021/04/image-1617989397104.png[] while the original article https://chinadigitaltimes.net/chinese/664606.html stores images locally: https://chinadigitaltimes.net/chinese/files/2021/04/image-1617989397104.png[]. This approach is more censorship resistant, since all images are under a single domain, so takedown would require a full statically domain takedown, which would break other things. Although CDN blocks are not unheard of, e.g. as mentioned at: https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/267715/is-stack-overflow-accessible-in-china[].

Several of his now-banned songs praised methamphetamine, calling the illicit drug "wonderful" and capable of "erasing all worries" (our translation), and describing in detail the sensation of being high on meth. Li's livestreams also featured extravagant displays of wealth, including stacks of cash, luxury watches, and expensive sports cars."
** Lu Benwei (卢本伟, alias 55kai): "As for Lu Benwei, profanity eventually became his undoing. After being accused of using cheats when live-streaming a game in November 2017, Lu vehemently defended himself on his channel, insulting the content creator who made the accusation and instigating fans to verbally abuse him."
** Chen Yifa: "offense stemmed from a single live-streaming session in 2016. According to a widely circulated video, Chen made joking mention of historical events such as the Nanjing Massacre and Japan's occupation of northeast China. She also described a game character's movement as honoring the Yasukuni"
** Yang Kaili (楊凱莉, alias 莉哥): "Yang Kaili, or "Lige," was the only one of the four banned live-streamers to have broken the law.

In Part Three, Chapter 3, O'Brien explains the end goal of their evil government system to Winston:

____
In our world there will be no emotions except fear, rage, triumph, and self-abasement. Everything else we shall destroy--everything. Already we are breaking down the habits of thought which have survived from before the Revolution. We have cut the links between child and parent, and between man and man, and between man and woman. No one dares trust a wife or a child or a friend any longer. But in the future there will be no wives and no friends. Children will be taken from their mothers at birth, as one takes eggs from a hen. The sex instinct will be eradicated. Procreation will be an annual formality like the renewal of a ration card. We shall abolish the orgasm. Our neurologists are at work upon it now. There will be no loyalty, except loyalty towards the Party. There will be no love, except the love of Big Brother. There will be no laughter, except the laugh of triumph over a defeated enemy. There will be no art, no literature, no science. When we are omnipotent we shall have no more need of science. There will be no distinction between beauty and ugliness. There will be no curiosity, no enjoyment of the process of life. All competing pleasures will be destroyed. But always--do not forget this, Winston--always there will be the intoxication of power, constantly increasing and constantly growing subtler. Always, at every moment, there will be the thrill of victory, the sensation of trampling on an enemy who is helpless. If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face--for ever.'
____

On Part Two, Chapter 5, Winston explains the <<censorship,erasing of the past>> to Julia:

____
Do you realize that the past, starting from yesterday, has been actually abolished? If it survives anywhere, it's in a few solid objects with no words attached to them, like that lump of glass there. Already we know almost literally nothing about the Revolution and the years before the Revolution. Every record has been destroyed or falsified, every book has been rewritten, every picture has been repainted, every statue and street and building has been renamed, every date has been altered. And that process is continuing day by day and minute by minute. History has stopped. Nothing exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right. I know, of course, that the past is falsified, but it would never be possible for me to prove it, even when I did the falsification myself. After the thing is done, no evidence ever remains. The only evidence is inside my own mind, and I don't know with any certainty that any other human being shares my memories.

On Part Three, Chapter 4, The Law of Gravity quote perfectly illustrates the CCPs approach to lying:

____
Anything could be true. The so-called laws of Nature were nonsense. The law of gravity was nonsense. 'If I wished,' O'Brien had said, 'I could float off this floor like a soap bubble.' Winston worked it out. 'If he THINKS he floats off the floor, and if I simultaneously THINK I see him do it, then the thing happens.' Suddenly, like a lump of submerged wreckage breaking the surface of water, the thought burst into his mind: 'It doesn't really happen. We imagine it. It is hallucination.' He pushed the thought under instantly. The fallacy was obvious. It presupposed that somewhere or other, outside oneself, there was a 'real' world where 'real' things happened. But how could there be such a world? What knowledge have we of anything, save through our own minds? All happenings are in the mind. Whatever happens in all minds, truly happens.

____
The Controller, meanwhile, had crossed to the other side of the room and was unlocking a large safe set into the wall between the book- shelves. The heavy door swung open. Rummaging in the darkness within, "It's a subject," he said, "that has always had a great interest for me." He pulled out a thick black volume. "You've never read this, for example."

The Savage took it. "The Holy Bible, containing the Old and New Testaments" he read aloud from the title-page.

"Nor this." It was a small book and had lost its cover.

"The Imitation of Christ"

"Nor this." He handed out another volume.

"The Varieties of Religious Experience. By William James."

"And I've got plenty more," Mustapha Mond continued, resuming his seat. "A whole collection of pornographic old books. God in the safe and Ford on the shelves." He pointed with a laugh to his avowed library to the shelves of books, the rack full of reading-machine bobbins and soundtrack rolls.

____
After authenticating the material, with the help of data security analysts Internet 2.0, IPAC passed the database to four media organisations around the world, including The Mail on Sunday.

Security sources believe the initial data leak came from a dissident who targeted an outwardly unremarkable office block in Shanghai which housed the records.

Despite the near certainty of being executed for treason if caught, he or she probably accessed it via a server before downloading it on to a laptop and releasing it on Telegram where it was found by <<ipac,IPAC>>.

The database was originally leaked on Telegram, the encrypted instant messaging app, and passed in September by a Chinese dissident to the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC), which comprises more than 150 legislators around the world who are concerned by the influence and activities of the Chinese government.

==== Internal censorship is necessary to prevent fake USA accounts from creating harmful propaganda

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_China
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/中华人民共和国言论审查

The USA cannot create enough fake accounts to overwhelm real 1.5 billion Chinese accounts, especially considering things like forcing mobile number account verification.

Chinese politicians are just using this fear as an excuse to stay in power: <<evil-west>>.

What if a Chinese person who really loves China and wants to improve the country disagrees with the Government?

What if this person is right, and wants to express this publicly to get support and make change happen?

Should this person just be put into jail as is done currently? Do you really think that the CCP can never do anything seriously wrong? <<chinese-politicians-really-care-about-the-chinese-citizens>>?

When citizens stop trying to contribute due to fear, this is known as the <<chilling-effect>>.

What if a <<is-chinese-politician-x-evil,politician>> does something bad, and <<corruption,suppresses the news to protect themselves>>?

Without freedom of speech, who will watch over the actions of those in power? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quis_custodiet_ipsos_custodes%3F[Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?]

____
I hear always the admonishment of my friends:

"Bolt her in, constrain her!"

But who will guard the guardians? The wife plans ahead and begins with them.

With internal censorship, leaders inevitably become <<xi-jinping,Gods>>, and soon zealous sons betray their fathers and brothers in loyalty to the leader and their fake ideal. See for example: <<man-in-the-high-castle>>.

[[man-in-the-high-castle]]

The famous https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Heine[Heinrich Heine] (German but from the 19th century, before the Nazis) saying also comes to mind:

____

Do you not think that this translates well to the modern version:

____
Where they have deleted online posts, they will end in deleting human beings.

The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_of_books_and_burying_of_scholars[Burning of books and burying of scholars] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/焚书坑儒[焚书坑儒], 212 BC) also comes to mind.

It is actually easier for the USA to manipulate a dictatorship than a democracy, because then all you have to do is buy/blackmail a few key corrupt politicians instead of manipulating millions of people's feeds.

.Internal censorship is so strong, that many Chinese people who leave China to live abroad continue to believe that the CCP is always right, despite having access evidence that suggests otherwise. This <<rebel-pepper>> 2019-08 cartoon shows frogs coming out of a big well still remain inside their own small wells made up of Chinese media such as <<zhihu-purge,Zhihu>> and CCTV.

==== China has more freedom of speech than the USA!

When you hear that online, it really makes you wonder if those people believe it or are <<wumao,paid to say it>>.

Luckily, this is easy to verify: just create an online account on a Chinese website, and start posting about censored political subjects, and wait for your account to get banned.

Then create an account on an American website, and start posting about censored political subjects. The first good question is: what will you post about since no political subject is censored?

Here is one concrete and well documented example: <<zhihu-purge>>.

Or maybe why not <<t-shirt,go out on the street in China with a T-shirt with censored words and share some photos online>>?

[[dictator-needs-gfw]]
===== Would ending the Great Firewall truly end the dictatorship?

Not 100% sure.

In <<russia>>, for example, the Internet is relatively free, but the government controls most professional media, which is what most people end up seeing, by suing dissidents media out of business.

But on the other hand Russia is already much freer than China.

Although I don't like them, I can't deny one thing: the commies are smart, and when they do something (e.g. censorship), it tends to keep them in power.

===== The Great Firewall is necessary to protect China from harmful USA propaganda and data collection

<<ciro-santilli>> doesn't think this is below the USA, but:

* without censorship, you would be much richer and stronger, and more able to defend yourselves
* why does China also censor its own people in addition to foreign propaganda?
* maybe this fear is greatly emphasized by the Chinese government beyond truth just to help them keep control of the country by fear and maintain their own power. Can the Americans really have that much influence in your country? <<evil-west>>
* maybe the regions that want to split from China feel like China is not giving them anything back, and they are themselves looking for allies outside of China to help them split. With democracy, people are more likely to get what they want, and there will be split parties and votes.
* the same argument can be used to justify any action, no matter how bad. E.g.: we must put all who criticize the government in jail, or else they will make China less united and weaker against the USA!

<<deng-xiaoping>> notably had this ideology, even though he explicitly recognizes that there are also <<censorship-makes-countries-poorer,benefits to not having online censorship>>:

This Chrome extension helps to quickly archive pages: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wayback-machine/fpnmgdkabkmnadcjpehmlllkndpkmiak

But remember that if you archive too many in a very quick succession before the previous ones have been archived, even if manually through that plugin, your account/IP might get blocked, so just give a few seconds for the current archive to terminate before starting new ones.

This happened to Ciro in 2020-06-14, but then he emailed the admins as mentioned at: https://help.archive.org/hc/en-us/articles/360016379432-Accounts-Tips-Troubleshooting- and they re-enabled it.

It is possible to request social media pages you own to be removed from the archive in some circumstances: https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/143529/is-it-possible-to-request-to-remove-page-snapshots-from-a-personal-social-media

Some website specific techniques:

* YouTube videos: they do seem to download them!
** But as as of 2020, they seem to have some serious bugs failing with "Sorry the Wayback Machine does not have this video (<id>) archived (or not indexed yet)." on most videos: https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/149933/why-does-the-archive-org-of-most-youtube-videos-fail-with-sorry-the-wayback-mac
** And the interface may be very broken, possibly due to the arabic youtube interface, you might just have to click around sometimes. So the best thing is to just always use the magic direct video link: of form: https://web.archive.org/web/2oe_/http://wayback-fakeurl.archive.org/yt/<video-id>
** E.g. a deleted pair from <<aaron-dewitt>>:
*** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d81mEbL8Yw8&feature=youtu.be
*** https://web.archive.org/web/20201103072718if_/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d81mEbL8Yw8&feature=youtu.be
** It is possible to get a raw mp4 link with as mentioned at https://forum.videohelp.com/threads/391951-How-to-download-a-YouTube-video-archived-by-Wayback-Machine: https://web.archive.org/web/2oe_/http://wayback-fakeurl.archive.org/yt/<video-id> e.g.: https://web.archive.org/web/2oe_/http://wayback-fakeurl.archive.org/yt/c6uFGGunRxc[], the download did work on 2020-12-31.

And no, you can't Wayback Machine archive an archive.is, they blocked the domain.

Has specific LinkedIn handling as it has a logged scrape account, e.g.: https://archive.vn/EPaEH[]. TODO find account URL.

Also has specific GitHub handling, e.g. as seen at: https://github.com/TinkoffCreditSystems/invest-openapi/issues/278 TODO what for?

Their github account was: https://github.com/volth an archive https://archive.vn/kqftP The account was completely deleted presumaly after GitHub noticed the anti-ToS usage: all their issues created have been deleted, not converted to ghost as happens with account deletion, and non-owners cannot delete their issues, only comments.

* https://github.com/TinkoffCreditSystems/invest-openapi/issues/278 "Инструменты "для квалифицированных инвесторов" недоступны через API" is a sample issue in fluent Russian

Google photo matches exactly this "Masha Rabinovich" https://www.linkedin.com/in/masha-rabinovich-52aa3a197/[], or is just some image of a well known person? Account marked as "Bachelor of Engineering" at the Humboldt University of Berlin.

The same photo seems to be used for all fetches: https://archive.vn/IPEEd[].

Googling name leads to an YouTube account whose only video is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1bp1VxMwP4 | https://archive.vn/9Xq6w "How to make an archive.is link with selection hashtag", so yes, the relation is almost certain.

https://www.northkoreatech.org/2016/09/21/north-koreas-dns-files-reveal-internet-websites/ has an archive.is related comment by an user of the same name Masha Rabinovich: September 22, 2016 at 17:55 "There are some more websites in .kp: http://archive.is/*.kp"

In 2008 they had some interest in compilers: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/tinycc-devel/2008-11/msg00015.html The obvious gmail email can be obtained from there.

Wikipedia suggests that the name Masha Rabinovich is likely of Russian Ashkenazi Jewish origin:

Google caches every indexed page that shows up on the search, you just have to click on the arrow and select "Cache" to see it.

The advantage over <<wayback-machine>> is that Google crawls many more pages than the Wayback Machine.

How to get the Google cache for a given URL: https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/15633/how-to-modify-a-url-to-get-a-google-cached-version-of-page

It is not possible however to see old caches, therefore you have to archive the Google caches with <<wayback-machine>> if you find anything interesting in them to not lose it:

* https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/45306/how-do-you-view-all-the-cached-versions-of-a-web-page
* https://support.google.com/websearch/thread/18638126?hl=en

The Google cache also has a text-only mode which is great for more complex webpages like those on <<zhihu>>, which due to JavaScript madness keep showing and disappearing.

====== geoscreenshot

https://www.geoscreenshot.com

Takes screenshots of the websites much like <<wayback-machine>>, but you can select the location.

Once the screenshot is made, you can "view the HTML", and that gives an Amazon AWS link, and warns that JavaScript and CSS might/will be disabled. The screenshot does not state what the origin URL/data is, so it cannot be used as a proof. But we can <<wayback-machine>> archive it to make sure it remains visible. E.g.:

* 2020-09-30 https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship | http://web.archive.org/web/20200930075102/https://s3.amazonaws.com/geoscreenshot-static/d3fdb97d-2ac3-4f57-a737-6fab2997fb1a.html see also <<github-censored-subdomains>>

* 2020-09-30 https://cirosantilli.com/china-dictatorship/ | https://archive.vn/bIzkH see alo <<mirrors>>

The free trial is very limited, and you can't share the screenshots on a public URL. See also: <<censorship-monitoring>>.

====== Geo Targetly

https://geotargetly.com/

This one can actually share screenshots for different countries, nice: https://geotargetly.com/geo-browse?url=https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues/266&country_code=CN

Small deatail: it doesn't work, or it takes forever, either one.

====== TLS 1.3 ENSI

* https://blog.cloudflare.com/encrypted-sni
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication#Encrypted_Client_Hello

This amazing standardized feature encrypts the domain as well as the URL.

This means that censors are unable to block only certain websites via DNS blocks, which is one of the main techniques used. But they can still block by IP, no?

In 2020-08, it was reported that the firewall was already blocking it: https://www.zdnet.com/article/china-is-now-blocking-all-encrypted-https-traffic-using-tls-1-3-and-esni/

Therefore, <<what-should-western-countries-do-about-china,all the West has to do>> is to force all of its websites to serve ENSI-only!

* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/非经营性网站备案

Part of the <<internal-censorship,Internet censorship machine>>, although it predates the GFW proper.

It can be seen at the bottom of many many many websites, it is likely mandatory to display it.

If you see one of those, you already know hat it cannot be trusted for politics.

For example, https://archive.is/ePBM9[as of April 2020], the <<zhihu>> sidebar shows:

____
京 ICP 备 13052560 号 - 1

where "京" indicates that the certificate was issued by the Beijing Provincial level city.

Some fear that only state media and official propaganda accounts will get permission.

This is where the Internet censors work.

[[cac-report-website]]
====== CAC report website (中央网信办举报网站)

These are official Chinese government websites that can be used to report cybercrime, including fraud and identity theft, but also political <<thoughtcrime,thoughcrime>>:

* http://www.cac.gov.cn/hdzx/jbzx/A091102index_1.htm
* https://www.12321.cn
* http://12377.cn

Reports such as https://www.theage.com.au/world/asia/china-exporting-ccp-speech-controls-to-australia-as-second-university-caught-in-row-20200805-p55irf.html highlighted that these websites has a "report harmful or garbage information" entry, which can notably be used by Chinese expats to report people who badmouth the CCP, and in particular other Chinese nationals.

Typing "国家互联网信息办公室" on Google autocompleted to "国家互联网信息办公室举报" (举报 == report), and finds http://www.cac.gov.cn/hdzx/jbzx/A091102index_1.htm[].

This is clearly an official government website due to the `gov.cn` URL, and it also has an <<icp-license>>.

One of the categories of report on that page is: "网络不良与垃圾信息举报受理中心" (center for reporting harmful or garbage information, https://web.archive.org/web/20200704135840/http://www.cac.gov.cn/hdzx/jbzx/A091102index_1.htm[archive]).

Notably, there is one separate entry for illegal activity as well (网络违法犯罪举报网站) and another one for <<porn,pornography (中国扫黄打非网)>>, so it is interesting to see that there is one specifically for "misinformation".

The harmful information page redirects to: https://www.12321.cn/ (https://web.archive.org/web/20200907150310/https://www.12321.cn/[archive]) which has further categories.

The "report website" (举报不良网站) category links to https://www.12321.cn/web (https://web.archive.org/web/20200807060758/https://www.12321.cn/web[archive]) and then has a "link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactionary[reactonary] and <<politically-sensitive,politically sensitive>>" (link:https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/反动[反动]及<<politically-sensitive,政治敏感>>) checkbox.

After you submit, it leads you to: https://www.12321.cn/suc (https://web.archive.org/web/20200807063330/https://www.12321.cn/suc[archive]) in which you can optionally provide further contact details: https://www.12321.cn/reg[]. This appears to be no link with the previous page, so they might just do it via IP. Registration requires both a cell phone and an email.

From the website source code (very simple, hand written, we see that it uses <<baidu,Baidu Analytics>>. The CCP obviously trusts Baidu a lot :-)

On 2020-09-07, <<mirrors,cirosantilli.com/china-dictatorship>>'s Google Analytics had a hit coming from http://jbcz.12377.cn/report/center/web.index[] ("This site can't be reached" on Chrome). This was soon after <<ciro-santilli>> mentioned <<cac-report-website>> at https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues/149#issuecomment-688084645[]. This is presumably the censor's web UI to review reports. "jb" from jbcz presumably means Ju Bao (举报), the CZ Ciro couldn't guess. 2020-10-14 had another hit from: http://jbcz.12377.cn/report/load/operate.index[].

The toplevel http://12377.cn (https://web.archive.org/web/20200907235842/https://www.12377.cn/[archive]) is entitled "中央网信办（国家互联网信息办公室）违法和不良信息举报中心" and is another report website. It is also linked to from http://www.cac.gov.cn/hdzx/jbzx/A091102index_1.htm under different categories, so it is also official.

The first category in that page is "政治类" (political category). From there we have some awesome information.

First it links to the report guidelines (举报指南) https://www.12377.cn/jbzn.html?tab=4 (https://web.archive.org/web/20200902094911/https://www.12377.cn/jbzn.html?tab=4[archive])

____

Please report illegal and harmful information on the Internet of martyrs and other content.
____

so yes, attacking the party and major policies is illegal in China, big news, right? "Involved in attacking the party and state system and major policies" is then one of the categories in the report page.

Soon after the previous events in 2020-09-08, anaytics got a hit from http://openurls.com.cn/ to https://cirosantilli.com/china-dictatorship[]. The only function of that website appears to be to open a newline separated list of websites into separate tabs. Maybe a censor bulk quickly having a look at several tasks. It is basically a clone of https://www.openallurls.com/[] but with an <<icp-license>> :-) The 2020-10-14 hit from http://jbcz.12377.cn was followed by another hit from http://openurls.com.cn/[], further reinforcing that this is part of their review procedure. 3 more hits on `/` and `/ciro-santilli` on 2020-02-22 after pinging a few people on https://github.com/zaohmeing/21- issues. Another hit 2021-03-19 to https://cirosantilli.com[], unknown cause.

[[wumao]]
==== Wumao (五毛)

50 Cent Party, 五毛党, Wumao Dang:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50_Cent_Party
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/网络评论员

They can be classified as a form of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_warfare[information warfare] (link:https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/信息战[信息战]).

A wise person once said:

____
It is impossible to distinguish wumaos, <<little-pink,idiots>> and <<not-chinese,brain washed>> people. So we just call all of them wumaos.
____

But of course, the <<ccp-cult,CCP is a cult>> (and <<democracy-is-a-religion,democracy, a religion>>), and therefore <<preconceived,any discussion is also pointless>> in general.

To a large extent, wumao's goals are to dilute useful conversation with shit, normally <<evil-west>> and <<western-democracies-are-not-perfect>>.

This leads to endless idiotic conversions of type:

____
You: Chinese friend, your house is on fire, let's try to put the fire out!

Wumao: I don't care, your house is also on fire!

You: that's true, that fire is also very serious, and I'm trying to put it out!

Wumao: look everyone, his house is on fire! Mine isn't!
____

Therefore, it is crucial to have a working algorithmic policy to handle them: <<how-to-deal-with-wumaos>>.

Notable wumaos <<what-should-western-countries-do-about-china,should be investigated by intelligence agencies>>.

If it is determined that they are knowingly funded by China, they should be put into jail as foreign agents.

There is a tradeoff between privacy rights and snuffing out wumaos, and it is hard to decide where to set the line. But snuffing out wumaos is important, and must be done.

If we were to give up on privacy completely, one possible rule would be: block anyone that lives in China and whose revenue therefore cannot be investigated properly by your government to determine if they are funded by the CCP.

Here are some people completely against blocking wumaos. Those silly Democrats never prepare well enough for war:

* https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/22/opinion/how-to-counter-chinas-global-propaganda-offensive.html
** it mentions the "Countering Information Warfare Act of 2016" https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/2692[], which is exactly what Western countries should do

The <<baidu-baike>> definition of wumao https://baike.baidu.com/item/五毛/24163406[] (https://archive.vn/mADIL[archive])) is priceless:

____
五毛，网络流行语，指收钱为某单位在网络上说好话的人

The little pink rabbit is generally called simply "那兔" (That Rabbit) derived from the Chinese title.

===== Where to find wumaos

Wumaos are particularly easy to spot on <<censorship-monitoring,Western websites banned in China>> and when written in English, since there is no way that strong pro-CCP opinions would get any support in such circumstances:

* <<quora>> is completely infested by wumaos as of 2020, see more information on that section

When they write in Chinese, it is much harder to know if they are paid or not, most are just <<stupid,brainwashed>>, some places to find them:

* <<zhao-heming>>

[[ccp-apologists]]
===== CCP apologists (中共辩护士)

If it is ever proven that those people are directly supported by the Chinese government, their nationalities should be revoked, it is very simple.

<<ciro-santilli>> feels that it is unlikely however that the CCP directly pays those apologists, as that would be too risky for both parties.

Rather, Ciro believes that they are either:

* saying that the CCP is good to get more views and ad revenue from CCP supporters that want to hear it from a white (most cases)
* even bigger complete idiots who actually believe China is good (the minority)

Then, when they reach a certain size, the CCP can support them indirectly, notably by featuring them in <<chinese-government-media>> such as <<cgtn>>, e.g. as happened <<nathan-rich>> at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRK1XDlZkng[], in order to boost their views and ad revenue.

For this reason, it is very hard to stop them without quenching freedom of expression.

Ciro's currenty recommended approach is the following: if a proeminent pro-CCP YouTubber never ever criticized the CCP, and it gets featured in CCP media, treat that channel exactly as you should treat CCP media, which is by adding a notice at the bottom along the lines of:

____
This account supports the Chinese Government, which is a fucking murderous dictatorship.
____

followed by a funny meme image that is forbidden in China, e.g. <<xi-jinping-memes>>.

It would be amazing if we could demonetize the apologist channels only for views coming from Chinese citizens, but that seems hard without completely destroying privacy?

Related discussion at: <<what-should-western-countries-do-about-china>>.

It is also interesting to note that many of them don't speak a word of Chinese, or very basic Chinese. It is fine when you say "the CCP is great" as a foreigner, but if you say "the CCP is bad", then <<not-chinese>>.

William Brooke Joyce (24 April 1906 – 3 January 1946), nicknamed Lord Haw-Haw, was an American-born British fascist politician and Nazi propaganda broadcaster to the United Kingdom during World War II. He took German citizenship in 1940.

Joyce was convicted of one count of high treason in 1945 and sentenced to death, with the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords both upholding his conviction. He was hanged on 3 January 1946, making him the last person to be executed for treason in the United Kingdom.
