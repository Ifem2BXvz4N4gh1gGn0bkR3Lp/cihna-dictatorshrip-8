Forbidden:

-   don't at mention @cirosantilli (or other unsubscribed users) unless there is moderation need.

    If Ciro unsubscribed from a thread, it means that he does not want to reply there anymore.

    Create a new issues instead if you are arriving at a thread created by someone else and a have a new relevant point.

-   don't close your tickets, only @cirosantilli can decide open/close status.

    Don't vandalize your titles and post bodies after posting, only @cirosantilli can do that.

-   don't create more than one boring shitpost issues

    If you want to create one shitpost, even if boring and stupid to vent your rage, fine, Ciro doesn't have any problem with that and is happy to help.

    You can swear as much as you want on that post, no problem.

    But if you start creating lots of boring shitposts, you are in danger of getting blocked.

    As a rule of thumb, three immediate idiotic new issues gets you blocked, tracking those under: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/labels/spam

    So instead of creating multiple boring shitposts, please just edit your initial boring shitpost, or add new comments there.

    People don't have that much time to waste.

    If you are still certain that you want really want to shitpost, first see some tips at: https://cirosantilli.com/china-dictatorship#shitpost

    Remember, you are threading dangerous waters, it is "one Ciro against one million wumaos", and so Ciro doesn't even blink anymore when a block might apply.

    But as long as you follow our [shitiquette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiquette), you should be fine.

-   [Evil West](https://cirosantilli.com/china-dictatorship#evil-west) posts are OK, but they *must* explain why you think a dictatorship would better solve the problem.

    Further rationale at: https://cirosantilli.com/china-dictatorship#bias

-   swearing/being very aggressive on a [`not-shitpost`](https://cirosantilli.com/china-dictatorship#shitpost) post.

    Keep in mind that [Ciro's Chinese sucks](https://cirosantilli.com/china-dictatorship#does-ciro-santilli-speak-chinese), so he may not get the full nuance of your comment, especially if you use a ton of [slang](https://cirosantilli.com/china-dictatorship#slang).

-   if you make a comment and delete, people who received notifications can still find your username: https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/1833#issuecomment-660128741 so think twice before doing that on a non-shitpost thread that Ciro is subscribed to.

    Shitposting and owning up to it is one thing, but shitposting, generating notifications, and being a coward by immediately deleting your comment, makes you getting blocked much more likely.

    On `shitpost` posts however, you can be as aggressive as you want.

-   if you create an issue and then block cirosantilli, you will be blocked too in return. The label is: [op-blocked-ciro](https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/labels/op-blocked-ciro)

Punitive measures, from least serious to most serious:

-   block user on one website. This may have the unintended side effect of deleting previous useful comments the user made on the websites. 

-   delete comment or vandalize the user's post.

    Actually, the main reason Ciro Santilli bans non-notification generators is not that he gives a fuck about the insults, but rather that he wants to prevent the OP from editing away his amazing post vandalisms.

    These will be tracked under: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/labels/vandalized

-   if your title contains the words 傻逼 or any variants, and no other interesting content, a ban + vandalization is likely

-   ban all known accounts of an user over multiple websites

Constructive disagreement will never be interfered with.

If you wish to appeal a punitive measure, please contact me through some unblocked method, and your request will be reviewed. "I'm sorry I got mad that time" will get you out of jail for first time offenders.

I will not reply anything non-trivial on Chinese websites, since all of those will be taken down sooner or later, therefore wasting my time. I will just tell you to recontact on a non-Chinese website, or re-post your question with the answer on a Western website.

If OP someone shitposts on GitHub and gets blocked, I will just make that clear by taking a web archive, posting a link on my comment, and setting the `op-block` label on the person's post: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/labels/op-block
